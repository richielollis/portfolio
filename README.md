# richie-lollis-portfolio

Portfolio website for Richie Lollis.

## Description

This is a website that showcases my works as a web developer. There are simple nav links that will scroll the user to certain sections of the webpage.  There is a link to a resume in the nav bar as well.  The website includes an About Me, Works, and Contact Me section. In the works section the user will find images of recent projects. These images are links and can be clicked to take the user to the project website. The Contact Me section has links for phone, email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
