        My name is Richie Lollis. I'm an aspiring web developer. In my free time
        I like to spend time with my wife. I also enjoy playing music, hanging
        out with my friends, and finding great places to eat. I have a cat whose
        name is Milo. He loves to play and eat food all the time.
